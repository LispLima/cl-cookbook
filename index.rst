.. The Common Lisp Cookbook documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

========================
The Common Lisp Cookbook
========================

This is a collaborative project that aims to provide for Common Lisp something
similar to the `Perl Cookbook <http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cookbook/>`__
published by O'Reilly. More details about what it is and what it isn't can be
found in this `thread
<http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=m3it9soz3m.fsf%40bird.agharta.de>`__
from `comp.lang.lisp <news:comp.lang.lisp>`__.

The credit for finally giving birth to the project probably goes to
"dj\_special\_ed" who posted `this message
<http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=76be8851.0201222259.70ecbcb1%40posting.google.com>`__
to `comp.lang.lisp <news:comp.lang.lisp>`__.

If you want to contribute to the CL Cookbook, please send a pull request in or
file a ticket!

Yes, we're talking to you! We need contributors - write a chapter that's missing
and add it, find an open question and provide an answer, find bugs and report
them, (If you have no idea what might be missing but would like to help, take a
look at the `table of contents
<http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cookbook/toc.html>`__ of the Perl Cookbook.)
Don't worry about the formatting, just send plain text if you like - we'll take
care about that later.

Thanks in advance for your help!
