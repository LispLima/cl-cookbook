Pattern Matching & Regular Expressions
======================================

The `ANSI Common Lisp
standard <http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/index.html>`__
does not include facilities for pattern matching and regular
expressions, but a couple of libraries exist for this task. See the
respective `Cliki page <http://www.cliki.net/Regular%20Expression>`__
for details and links.

Note that some CL implementations include regexp facilities, notably
`CLISP <http://clisp.sourceforge.net/impnotes.html#regexp>`__ and
`ALLEGRO
CL <http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/6.1/doc/regexp.htm>`__.
If in doubt, check your manual or ask your vendor.
